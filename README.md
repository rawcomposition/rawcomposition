### G'day, mates ðŸ‘‹

I'm a birder ðŸ¦‰ (not a bird watcher, birding is more intense, like a sport). When I'm not birding or photographing birds, I'm probably programming. I enjoy combining my love for birds and programming by creating interesting web apps. I also work at SimpleUpdates.com as a full stack web developer. I'm an Aussie, but have now lived half my life in the US. Wow, time flies!

Recently, I've been focusing on learning React. You'll probably start to notice a few repositories along these lines in my account soon.
