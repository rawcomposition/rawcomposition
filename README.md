Iâ€™m a birder ðŸ¦‰ who loves traveling the world photographing rare birds. When Iâ€™m not birding, Iâ€™m busy building software that solves real-world problemsâ€”everything from an enterprise LMS for a global tire brand to a custom inventory tracking system. Iâ€™ve worked extensively on large-scale solutions to meet a variety of business needs, including company dealer portals, mobile apps, order lifecycle management solutions and non-profit crowdsourcing platforms.
