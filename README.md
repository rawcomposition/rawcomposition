### G'day, mates ðŸ‘‹

I'm a birder ðŸ¦‰. When I'm not birding or photographing birds, I'm probably programming. I enjoy combining my love for birds and programming by creating interesting web apps. I also work at SimpleUpdates.com as a full stack web developer. I'm an Aussie, but have now lived half my life in the US. Wow, time flies!

Recently, I've been focusing on learning React and loving it!
